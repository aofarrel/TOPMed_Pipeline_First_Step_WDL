# Tentative differnces between CWL and WDL versions
Work in progress. No promises are made about the accuracy of these comparsions.

## Overall Structure
The CWL calls other CWLs. The WDL does not.

Filenames are generated by calling the Seven Bridges API in the CWL. This isn't possible in WDL, so inputs are generated from JSONs instead.

## Runtime Attributes
The original CWL allocates memory and CPUs on an overall level, while the WDL does it on a task level. In other words, the WDL is more granular.

The original CWL does not have an option for disk space, likely because most people run CWL on an AWS instance (which scales automatically), while the WDL has attributes on a per-task level.

The WDL currently lacks the format argument.
