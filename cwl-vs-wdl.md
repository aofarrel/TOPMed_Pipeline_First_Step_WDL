# Tentative differnces between CWL and WDL versions
Work in progress. No promises are made about the accuracy of these comparsions.

## Overall Structure
The CWL calls other CWLs. The WDL does not.

Filenames are generated by calling the Seven Bridges API in the CWL. This isn't possible in WDL, so inputs are generated from JSONs instead.

The WDL relocalizes all files into the working directory in the unique variant IDs step, because otherwise generating a valid configuration file for the resulting R script seems to be impossible (at least on local runs). Please just trust me on this one.

## Config Files
Both the CWL and the WDL generate config files on a per-task basis. That is to say, a given task generates a brand new config file, *then* runs a single R script with that new config file. However, the WDL does this in Python, while the CWL does this in Javascript.

## Runtime Attributes
The original CWL allocates memory and CPUs on an overall level, while the WDL does it on a task level. In other words, the WDL is more granular.

The original CWL does not have an option for disk space, likely because most people run CWL on an AWS instance (which scales automatically), while the WDL has attributes on a per-task level.

The WDL currently lacks the format argument.
